As Ithaca experiences a snowstorm outside my window, I can tell the winter season is reaching its peak. I was ill for most of the time after coming back to the US through a very long flight journey from Indonesia. However, thanks to my fiancé, I get all the care I need.

Science update: I am still working on the winter raptor data exploration part and making a private repository for it

Life update: I am currently getting better and so much better now.

I will write more of my thoughts in the future with deeper, more elaborate writing. This is it for now.
But this website is not working.
