The thought of writing a research blog has been in my mind for a long time. Currently in my 3rd year of PhD I decided to take action: making a website of my research.
It has been a learning process. I have never properly used my GitHub account, even though I have it for so long. Github is still very new and feels distant compared to the R software that I have been using maybe about 8 years. Still I find that R is a vast world, always updating itself, and confusing. 

Github is another giant that I will tackle bit by bit, since I think my research projects will grow and more of my works need to be reproducible for continuity.

I need to say thanks to my partner: Charlie Tebbutt (now fiance) that his work on creating an academic websites pushing me to create something similar, but I know that "I have to make it in github" to force myself actually using this websites and having it astronomically cheap. 

So, after asking AI asssistant, this website starts becoming 'something'. I paid for my own domain for less than $15 from 'namecheap' website (what a deal!), then connect it into my github repo so it is now live as my own "Academic" website/posts. I know that I can just use a wordpress blog for my "academic' blog but something deep inside me telling that I should host it in github so that I can get used and visit this website at least everyday.

Making this website has been a dream come true for me and answering my curiosity for so long: that I know for sure github can be used this way. I just have been so scared in the past to actually using it and exploring it. 

Note to myself: just start something and be ready to get impressed by your own curiousity and persistence!
