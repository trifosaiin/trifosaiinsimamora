- a poetry -
  
Being human is being vulnerable  
Being aware of your own faults  
of other people's faults  
of the waves of emotions  
of the quiet line of the clouds  


the grey sky in the winter  
the cold breeze   
the fiery looking smoke    
swiftly going up the chimney  


Being human is ready to be disappointed   
of yourself  
of others  
of your own expectation  
of people's expectations  


humbling  
caring  


Being human is being strong  
being brave  
Care to walk forward  
want to be better  

Being human is still  
A beautiful thing
