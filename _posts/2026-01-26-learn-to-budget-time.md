There is a snow warning for today. The snow layers are about 50 cm from the walkway. Cornell University is closed only until noon.
I called Cornell Health and told them my situation, got a very short answer, and was told to buy over-the-counter Sudafed (apparently more effective), but I was not very amused by the way the person talking to me (too rushed, almost don't care). 

I went to Cornell Health, got covid + Flu A/B test, and did it at home. Well, seems like I am not having any of them (since my symptoms are mostly done)

I have conquered this flu (almost), so I took Benadryl here and then to make me breathe easier, but now I will replace it with newer, stronger Sudafed! Yay!

I will report the result of that. But, my main point of this post is: I need to budget my time spent on this website edit. I am spending too much time here.
I have a deadline to submit tomorrow. For the FWS application. AHHH.

Okay, I can do it! Until later!
