I am a Ph.D. candidate at Cornell University in the New York Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit.

My current research focuses on the interaction between renewable energy development and grassland birds. I aim to contribute evidence-based management for renewable energy siting and wildlife conservation. This website brings together my research, publications, field work notes, and ongoing projects.
